# my parting resources for casual programmers

### Practice

Consistency is the key for ongoing practise. You don't have to do a lot. just a little bit everyone day. 

I recommend one coding challenge/warmup a day. you can find coding challenges in the following places. 

- https://exercism.io/
- https://www.codewars.com/

You probably already know codewars. Exercism is an interesting one because you can get feedback on your code from mentors.

For even harder and longer problems try advent of code. And in Screeps you write the AI for an MMO game.

- https://adventofcode.com/
- https://leetcode.com/
- https://www.hackerrank.com/
- https://screeps.com/

If that's not enough? may be you're a closet SQL fan... highly recommend finishing sqlbolt

- https://sqlbolt.com/
- https://sqlzoo.net/
- http://datamonkey.pro/guess_sql/lessons/

or if writing & reading regular expressions sparks joy. even if it doesn't spend an hour doing regexone

- [regexone: interactive tutorials](https://regexone.com/)
- [regexr for testing](https://regexr.com/)
- [fixing links with regex](https://gist.github.com/epoch/df8d222745b99010a2210f3f00fdbaf6)

may be you've been craving for more CSS. Everybody does.

how about getting better at the terminal. solving crime on the command line

some frameworks you may want to checkout

- next.js
- zustand/jotai/redux/recoil
- react query
- svelte
- knex/objection/prisma
- moogoose

finally. react coding challenges

## staying informed

mailing list, podcasts, meetups & conferences

## programming languages

aside for job requirements, learning another programming language is a great way open up your mind to different paradigms and approaches on problem solving. which makes you a better thinker and programmer.

Some ideas that you want to learn 

- dynamic typing (javascript & ruby & python are all dynamically typed)
- static typing (typescript, rust)
- functional programming (haskell)
- concurrency (golang)
- memory management (rust)
- object oriented programming (ruby, kotlin)

so which one? typescript is a good start.

- https://www.typescriptlang.org/
- https://clojure.org/
- https://www.haskell.org/
- https://www.rust-lang.org/
- https://www.scala-lang.org/
- https://golang.org/
- https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
- https://www.edx.org/learn/python
- https://www.programiz.com/csharp-programming
